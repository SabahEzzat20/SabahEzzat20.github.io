        <h2 class="title">What is ENDOCRINE ?!</h2>
        <p><br>The Department of Endocrinology is concerned with the study of hormone production in the endocrine glands
            and the diagnosis and treatment of their disorders. Hormones are substances that are produced in very low
            concentrations and act in cells far from where they are produced. The endocrine system helps regulate the
            body's internal activities and its response to what is happening outside.<br>
            Hormones have a primary role in regulating all functions of cells and organs of the body, and in regulating
            metabolism, and consequently, imbalances in the secretion and work of hormones secreted by a number of
            endocrine glands lead to disturbances in the bodyâ€™s work and balance. The most important examples of
            endocrine diseases for adults and children are: diabetes, obesity, and diseases Thyroid and parathyroid
            glands, in addition to the adrenal glands, the pituitary gland, and others.</p><br>

        <p><br>Common daily cases in endocrinology
            Endocrinology includes a wide range of different diseases. Each gland in the endocrine system serves a
            specific purpose. Any defect, no matter how small, in one or more of these glands leads to a hormonal
            imbalance in the body and thus a glandular disorder.<br>
            Diabetes types 1 and 2 are the most common conditions seen in endocrinology clinics, but there are many
            other disorders, including:<br>
            Thyroid Disorders<br>
            Precocious puberty<br>
            Polycystic ovary syndrome<br>
            Growth Disorders<br>
            Cushing's Syndrome</p><br>

        <p><br>The Department of Endocrinology provides a variety of services to patients suffering from endocrine,
            metabolic, and diabetic diseases that include pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, menstrual disorders, gonadotropin
            diseases, male hypertrichosis and calcium metabolism disorders. Diagnosis and treatment of hypoglycemia and
            some other severe complications of diabetes and gestational diabetes.<br>
            Full services are also available for the treatment of obesity, osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension and
            thyroid disease.<br>
            Endocrinology resources are available to assist in the evaluation and treatment of patients with complex
            endocrine diseases.<br>
            The Endocrinology Department also provides specialized clinic services, including diabetes and pregnancy
            clinic, diabetes and kidney clinic, insulin pump clinic, and thyroid disorders and tumors clinic. And soon
            the pituitary clinic and the adult clinic.<br>
            We have the resources and capabilities that enable us to provide advanced medical care to diagnose various
            endocrine diseases. The endocrine system needs highly qualified doctors and a laboratory with modern and
            accurate equipment, in addition to modern radiology equipment. The hospital provides what is needed to treat
            various endocrine diseases and the resulting complications. Be it with drugs or even by surgical operations
            (if necessary), the hospital provides all the necessary equipment for this within the latest international
            quality standards.</p><br>

        <h2 class="title">Instructions For You</h2>
        <p><br>Where should the patient go?
            A person diagnosed with NEN should preferably be treated in a medical center that brings together experts
            from different fields who specialize in the disease and work as a multidisciplinary team: the team includes
            an oncologist, an endocrinologist, a surgeon, an imaging doctor, a specialist In nuclear medicine, etc.
            Combined therapy helps to make the right decisions regarding the course of treatment for the disease.<br>
            There are now many centers specialized in neuroendocrine tumors that are able to give patients the optimal
            answer required for the treatment and monitoring of their disease. A comprehensive study recently published
            found that when these patients were treated in centers specialized in this disease, where the treating staff
            had the necessary knowledge for the correct diagnosis and treatment of this disease, their life expectancy
            was significantly longer, compared to patients who were not treated in Centers specializing in this disease.
