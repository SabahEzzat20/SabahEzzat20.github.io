                    <br>
                    <p>Pediatric dentists encompass all aspects of oral
                        health care for developing children.
                        They perform many different procedures,
                        depending on each child's
                        needs and medical history. </p>
                    <p>
                        The most common pediatric dental services
                        include dental exams and cavity fillings.
                        These dentists also specialize in tooth extractions, preventive,
                        and restorative treatments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The American Dental Association (ADA) recommends that everyone should visit a dentist at least
                        every six months.

                        Parents should begin scheduling dentist visits within six months of a baby’s first tooth
                        eruption. This is typically between 6 months and one year of age.

                        During a pediatric dental exam, a child's mouth is examined for:

                        Signs of early childhood caries (ECC)
                        Gingivitis
                        Pediatric periodontal disease
                        Dental erosion
                        Other oral conditions
                        Dental fillings, stainless steel crowns, or extractions will be recommended if cavities are
                        detected. X-rays and disease screenings are also commonly used, depending on the patient's age
                        and medical history.

                    <h1>Implantology</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>A dental implant is a
                        prosthesis that interfaces with the bone of the jaw or skull to support a
                        dental prosthesis such as a crown, bridge, denture, or facial prosthesis or
                        to act as an orthodontic anchor. The basis for modern dental implants is a
                        biologic process called osseointegration, in which materials such as titanium
                        or zirconia form an intimate bond to bone. The implant fixture is first placed
                        so that it is likely to osseointegrate, then a dental prosthetic is added. A variable
                        amount of healing time is required for osseointegration before either the dental prosthetic
                        is attached to the implant or an abutment is
                        placed which will hold a dental prosthetic/crown.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <hr>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Success or failure of implants depends on the health of the person receiving
                        the treatment, drugs which affect the chances of osseointegration, and
                        the health of the tissues in the mouth. The amount of stress that will be
                        put on the implant and fixture during normal function is also evaluated.
                        Planning the position and number of implants is key to the long-term health
                        of the prosthetic since biomechanical forces created during chewing can be
                        significant. The position of implants is determined by the position and
                        angle of adjacent teeth, by lab simulations or by using computed tomography
                        with CAD/CAM simulations and surgical guides called stents. The prerequisites
                        for long-term success of osseointegrated dental implants are healthy bone and
                        gingiva. Since both can atrophy after tooth extraction, pre-prosthetic procedures
                        such as sinus lifts or gingival grafts are sometimes required to recreate ideal bone
                        and gingiva.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The final prosthetic can be either fixed, where a person cannot remove the denture or
                        teeth from their mouth, or removable, where they can remove the prosthetic.
                        In each case an abutment is attached to the implant fixture. Where the prosthetic
                        is fixed, the crown, bridge or denture is fixed to the abutment either with lag
                        screws or with dental cement. Where the prosthetic is removable, a corresponding
                        adapter is placed in the prosthetic so that the two pieces can be secured together.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The risks and complications related to implant therapy divide into those that occur
                        during surgery (such as excessive bleeding or nerve injury), those that occur in the
                        first six months (such as infection and failure to osseointegrate) and those that
                        occur long-term (such as peri-implantitis and mechanical failures). In the presence
                        of healthy tissues, a well-integrated implant with appropriate biomechanical loads
                        can have 5-year plus survival rates from 93 to 98 percent and 10 to 15 year lifespans
                        for the prosthetic teeth.[4] Long-term studies show a 16- to 20-year success
                        (implants surviving without complications or revisions) between 52% and 76%,
                        with complications occurring up to 48% of the time.

                    <p>
                        The practice of endodontics is concerned primarily with the removal of diseased
                        dental pulp and its replacement with filling material, an operation known as root
                        canal therapy. After the pulp is removed, the tooth continues to be nourished by
                        connecting blood vessels in the jaw. The tooth is then considered
                        to be dead, although the fibres that hold the teeth in the jawbone are alive.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Operations on the pulp are performed with the aid of local anesthesia.
                        Preservation of the natural tooth in this manner serves both appearance and
                        utility; a natural tooth implanted in the jaw maintains the integrity of the
                        dental arch and can withstand about 10 times
                        more pressure than can artificial teeth.

                        This treatment is a great opportunity for those who take advantage
                        of it through early detection for those who are under 15 years old.

                        he will undergo surgery, so it is the role of parents to
                        monitor the growth of their children's teeth and follow up

                        up with your private doctor, you must commit to brushing
                        your teeth at least twice a day because braces are a double-edged sword that can
                        repair your smile or cause it to spoil.

                    <br>
                    <p>Dental care is often delayed due to other responsibilities. This isn't unusual, but should be
                        avoided. And if you haven't had your teeth professionally cleaned for many years, plaque and
                        tartar may have built up considerably.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> When this happens, it can be hard for a dentist to examine your mouth's hard and soft tissues.
                        This can interfere with their ability to fully assess dental health. In this case, a full mouth
                        debridement may be recommended.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> A full mouth debridement (FMD) is a nonsurgical procedure done by a dentist or dental specialist
                        like a periodontist. An FMD helps remove extensive plaque and tartar buildup from your teeth and
                        under gums.</p>
